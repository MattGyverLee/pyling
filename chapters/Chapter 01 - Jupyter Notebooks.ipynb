    "The core concept behind Jupyter notebooks is that of the [narrative](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/narrative-notebook.html). Based on the concept of a scientists notebook which contains data observations coupled with analytic narrative, the Jupyter Notebook offers a way for writing narrative text interspersed with Python code. Those narratives and code are displayed underneath the hood using fancy HTML and Javascript. You never have to worry about this under the hood stuff. But it is good to know what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text you're reading now is written in what's known as [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The link there contains a cheatsheet about how to write pretty text in markdown. You can do things like add **bolded text** by wrapping text with double asterix: `**your text here**`. Or you can indicate headings with a hashtag: `# A Primary Heading` or `## A Secondary Heading`. \n",
